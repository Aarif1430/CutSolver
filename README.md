# CutSolver

This is used to solve the "Cutting Stock Problem", which is NP-hard.  
It can be reduced to the Bin-Packing-Problem (BPP).

Brute Force(best solution) for small n, Heuristic(fast solution) f√ºr larger n

# Usage
Start flask service locally using `flask run` in project folder.

# Roadmap
Host as backend
Make a nice UI with Bootstrap?

## Declined
Having workers and a queue with pending jobs was considered but seemed useless, 
as ideally all requests have their own thread and a (by comparison) short calculation time.
This makes a queue useless. The same argumentation also holds for a result-buffer.

# Visualisation
// This should definitely be a svg.

# Troubleshooting

## My results are missing decimals
This Solver is using ints exclusively, try to use whole numbers instead.
